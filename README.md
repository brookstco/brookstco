### Hello!
I am Colin Brooks. I am a university senior majoring in Computer Science.

This account is for my personal projects. I code primarily in C# and python, and have used C for several university projects.

If you are an employer who is interested in seeing my work, I also have a [school github account](https://github.com/cfb5264) for my university programming projects. Notably are a C implementaion of Malloc, multithreading in C, a Python Lexer and Parser, and Python machine learning models. Those projects are required to be private, but I can share them with potential employers. You can shoot me an email at brookstco@gmail.com, and I'll get you the code.

I also do some game development as a hobby, but most of my work has been done in Gamemaker Studio, so I have not uploaded it here. You can see my nicer finished work on [Itch](https://cbrooks.itch.io/).
