### Hello!
I am Colin Brooks. I am a university senior majoring in Computer Science at Penn State.

This account is for my personal projects. I code primarily in C# and python, and have used C for several university projects. I am currently learning Swift and SwiftUI and will be working more with databases next semester.

If you are an employer who is interested in seeing my work, I also have a [school github account](https://github.com/cfb5264) for my university programming projects. Notably are a C implementaion of Malloc, multithreading in C, a Python Lexer and Parser, and Python Tensorflow machine learning models using google colab. Those projects are required to be private, but I can share them with potential employers. You can send me an email at brookstco@gmail.com, and I'll send you the code.

I also do some game development as a hobby, but most of my work has been done in Gamemaker Studio 2, so I have not uploaded the code here. You can see my nicer finished work on [Itch](https://cbrooks.itch.io/).
